<p>The start delay is a number in seconds and can be specified if you have more than one execution plan to execute. 
The execution plans will be started sequentially with the specified delay.<br />
This can be helpful if you need to minimize the workload on the test environment at startup (e.g. starting a virtual machine or installing the AUT).<br/>
<b>Note:</b> If you cannot execute the execution plans in parallel, it is recommended to add a new build step.
