    Enter an existing execution definition id on your SilkCentral Test Manager system. 
    You can enter more than one id by using a comma separated list of ids (e.g. 12345,3389), but each specified execution definition must be in the same project otherwise you need an additional builder configuration.
    The execution order of the specified execution definition cannot be affected in this way. If you need a specific order you need an additional builder configuration. 
    The given execution definitions will be started in parallel if the configuration of SilkCentral Test Manager allows this.
    Look into the documentation of SilkCentral Test Manager for more information about this topics.
