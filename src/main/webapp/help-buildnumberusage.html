<p>Choose an option how the build number should be provided to SilkCentral Testmanager:
<ul>
 <li><b>Don't care about a build number:</b> No build number is used to start the test execution. It depends how SCTM is configured, but typically the execution definition are configured with a build number, which is used for the execution. For more information read the documentation of SCTM. This option should also be used if you write a 'buildinfo-file' by your own.</li>
 <li><b>Use last build number added on SCTM:</b> Use the latest build number for this product and version configured on the SCTM. For more information how you can configure products and versions read the documentation of SCTM.</li>
 <li><b>Use build number from this job:</b> Simply execute the test execution on SCTM with the current build number of the hudson job.</li>
 <li><b>Use build number from upstream job:</b> For this option the build number a upstream job is taken for the test execution on SCTM.</li>
</ul>
